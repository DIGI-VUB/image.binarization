# image.binarization

This repository contains an R package for Binarizing Images focusing on local adaptive thresholding with the purpose of improving

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR)

### Installation

- For installing the development version of this package: `remotes::install_github("DIGIT-VUB/image.binarization")`
- Note that the package requires a compiler with C++17 capabilities

Look to the documentation of the functions

```
help(package = "image.binarization")
```

## Example

Get an image, put it into gray scale and binarise it using the method by `Su`

```{r}
library(magick)
library(image.binarization)
img <- image_read("scan.jpg")
img <- image_convert(img, format = "PGM", colorspace = "Gray")
img
img <- image_binarization(img, type = "su")
img
```
